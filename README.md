## Reducing the Energy Expenses of Residential Customers by Designing a Deep Learning Method (Hybrid CNN-LSTM). 
#### The aim of this project is to design a deep learning method for individual household power forecast of residential customers. A density based clustering technique will be implemented to evaluate the dynamic behavior in the residential power profile. A deep learning method will be proposed to forecast individual residential power consumption  
## Smart Grid Smart City (SGSC) Database
The SGSC project was initiated by the Australian government in 2010. It was the first commercial scale project in Australia. SGSC gathered smart meter data of around ten thousand customers in New South Wale.This database helps to enhance the study of various smart grid technologies. Short-term individual household load forecasting is one of the key research areas that can make use of this database.
